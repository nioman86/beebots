// The Beekeeper: an outside coach (a Zap on Zapier) that looks at all three bees on a schedule and may rewrite one
// bee's rules through the door (lab/door.ts). The engine starts every round itself: it POSTs a small JSON to the
// Zap's Catch Hook with its own public address and a 15-minute key for that round. So the Zap holds no secret and no
// address of its own: it reads GET /keeper/scorecard here, decides, and signs its one POST /lab/overlay with the
// round's key. Every round is a row in keeper_rounds, and what the public sees of it (bee, one-liner, idea) rides
// /snapshot and the live feed. The key and the hook URL are never stored in a log, never served.
//
// Nothing in here may throw into the engine: tick(), onAlert(), start() and publicState() catch everything.
